## 🎯 How This Tutorial Works

1. **You'll be coding** - I'll provide instructions and you'll implement the code
2. **Test as you go** - Each step includes testing instructions
3. **Learn by doing** - Build real components with real functionality
4. **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, build up to advanced concepts

## 📚 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Basic Components
- **Step 1**: Create your first React component
- **Step 2**: Add props and event handling
- **Step 3**: Implement state management with useState
- **Step 4**: Build a counter component

### Phase 2: Intermediate Concepts
- **Step 5**: Create a user list with filtering
- **Step 6**: Build a form with validation
- **Step 7**: Implement conditional rendering
- **Step 8**: Add custom hooks

### Phase 3: Backend Integration
- **Step 9**: Set up Fastify backend
- **Step 10**: Create API service layer
- **Step 11**: Connect React to backend
- **Step 12**: Add error handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the React project
cd react-learning/ui

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## 📝 Tutorial Instructions

Each step will include:
- **Concept explanation** - What you're learning
- **Code instructions** - What to implement
- **Testing steps** - How to verify your work
- **Next steps** - What to do after completion

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Working with the Code
```bash
# Navigate to the React app directory
cd react-learning/ui

# Start development server
npm start

# Make changes to files in ui/src/
# Test your changes in the browser
# Commit your progress
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# From the react-learning directory (not ui/)
git add .
git commit -m "Step X: Description of what you learned"
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 Configuration Files

### Frontend Configuration
- `ui/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `ui/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `ui/src/App.tsx` - Main application component
- `ui/src/App.css` - Global styles and theming

### Backend Configuration
- `backend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `backend/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Fastify server setup

## 🎯 Ready to Start?

Let's begin with **Step 1: Creating Your First React Component**!

Open your terminal, navigate to the `ui` directory, and let me know when you're ready to start coding!

## 📝 Notes

- All React development happens in the `ui/` directory
- Git repository is at the `react-learning/` level
- Commits should be made from the `react-learning/` directory
- The React app runs from the `ui/` directory
